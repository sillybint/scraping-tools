# Scraping Tools

So far this repo just contains a jupyter notebook for scraping images from reddit.
Gave it a more generic name incase I add more as I explore creating datasets for ML.

To use the notebook you'll need a [reddit app](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps), in order to get a client id token and a client secret.
